# py-astrology-playground
Different astrology-related Python scripts I'm messing around with. Not intended to be used for much of anything useful except learning and possible blogging aid for Phoenixia Astrolology.

## Included here so far:
- Weekly aspects fetch (weeklyretrieval.py)
- Processor for weekly output (weeklyprocessing.py)
- Monthly aspects fetch (monthlyretrieval.py)
- Processor for monthly output (monthlyprocessing.py)
- Retrograde cycle and sign change discovery notation

## To-Dos
- Alter API (that's a separate project) to generate weekly and monthly reports.
- Refine output
- HTML file generation?
